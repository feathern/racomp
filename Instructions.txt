When building:
1.)  Clone the master branch of the Rayleigh code (not Nick's fork)
2.)  Clone the racomp repo
3.)  Copy the master patch into your directory:
     cp /path/to/racomp/patch/* /path/to/racomp/patch_fredy/.
3.)  Configure Rayleigh with the following command:
        ./configure {other options, like -mkl} --with-custom=/path/to/racomp/patch
4.) Build rayleigh as usual

When editing:
Grab original code from src_copy
Place new code in patch_fredy (do not recreate subdirectory structure)

When compiling on summit, we just need to compile, not optimize.
ml gcc impi mkl
./configure -devel -mkl
make
